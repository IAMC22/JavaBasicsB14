Logical Operators:
		Logical operators help us test more than one condition.In java we have &&
		as the And operator and || Or operator and ! for NOt operator.
	Why we should learn logical operators?
		logical operators help us rduce the number of if-conditions that we write in
		certain cases.
	What is syntax?
	    if(condition1 && condition2){
	    
	    }
	    
	    if(condition1){
	      if(condition2){
	      syso"Hello";
	      }
	      }
