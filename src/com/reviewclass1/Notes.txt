Type Casting (primitive):
Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
For example we can convert a short byte a long to float etc..
THere are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/manual.

Implicit/widening/automatic Type casting:
When java converts the data types automatically for us. it only happens when we assigning
a smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is not data type lost in this conversion and it easily fits in the larger data type.

Explicit/narrowing/manual type casting:
When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called
explicit/narrowing/manual. It doesn't happen automatically we have to do it explicitly manually.

Why we should learn type casting?
When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code
from others to save time and we might also need to convert the data types to 
make our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax for type casting?
we use() and inside the () we write the destination data type for example
if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we do it.
long var1=250;
explicit/narrowing/manual ex:
int var2=(int)var1; // its explicit/narrowing/manual

Implicit/widening/automatic ex:
double var3=var2;
ex 2:
float f=250.5f;
doubled=f;

If else conditions
 Is else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
 Why we should learn a out if else?
  Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a web site our
  programs need to make a lot of decisions.
    IF (the given user name and password matches)\{go to home page} ELSE {user gives warning}
    What is the syntax for if else conditions?
  boolean isHungry=true;
  
  if(isHungry){ //always right something that is true or false or is the data type
  System.out.println("Please Eat Something");
  }else{
  System.out.println(Lets Build Java Programs")
  }
